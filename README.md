# Digital Predistorter Adaptation with a Level-Crossing
# Analogue-to-Digital Converter

The Matlab source codes are provided to supplement our research paper
"Digital Predistorter Adaptation with a Level-Crossing
Analogue-to-Digital Converter".

__Please note, that the provided Matlab codes execute simulations and no
measurement is performed. Provided power amplifier model does not
perfectly represent the real power amplifier, therefore the simulation
results do not comply with results presented in our paper.__

## Requirements

We have run simulations on Ubuntu OS, Matlab 2018a, but the
simulations should be OS independent and all Matlab versions > 2018 should
be compatible. Simulations should require no toolboxes.

## Simulation Execution

Run *RUN_ANALYSIS_01.m* to execute simulations.
During simulations, figures with linearisation performance metrics are
instantaneously plotted together with other important markers.
